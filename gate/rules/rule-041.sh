# Rule 41 — enforcer_anchor_resolves (enforcer E60, Phase M B2)
#
# Every artefact node in architecture-graph.yaml that carries an `anchor:`
# MUST also carry `anchor_resolves: true`. Closes the L1-expert P0-2 / P2-1
# gap: previously an enforcer row could point at a non-existent test method
# and pass Rule 28j (file-path existence). The graph builder now resolves
# anchors per file type (.java method declaration, .md heading, .sh function,
# .yaml top-level key) and this gate fails on any false.
